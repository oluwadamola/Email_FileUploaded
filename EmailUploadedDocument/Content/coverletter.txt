Dear Sir/Madam 

I wish to apply for the role of Junior Software Developer, currently being advertised on Jobberman.  
As you can see from my CV, I have recently completed some project, while some are not on my github page for security reason. 
I believe the knowledge and skills built up during my training in Andela, Lagos State Study Program(where i undergo the rudiment of programming)will make me the perfect candidate for this role.
The position particularly interests me because of my passion for the language and technology stated as requirement.

I believe my contribution will have an immediate impact on the business.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to meeting with you to discuss my application further. 

Yours sincerely
08060002485
